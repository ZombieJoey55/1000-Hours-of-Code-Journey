    <h2>Roadmap</h2>
    <p>
      So after spending many hours researching the best way to learn, as a
      visual learner, I decided to go with Udemy courses. These are high-quality
      video courses that I can learn from experienced tutors.

      So after spending many hours researching the best way to learn, as a

      video courses that I can learn from experienced tutors.
    </p>
    <p>
      After checking out many tutors on Udemy, I started to try out the two most
      popular tutors for web development, Dr. Angela Yu and Colt Steele.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the roadmap, I allocated the hours for each course based on its
      estimated duration. In programming courses, it’s recommended to spend 4–5
      hours practicing and applying concepts for every hour spent watching
      videos to effectively reinforce your learning.

    <h4>Summary</h4>
    <p>
      Day 1 was a great success, as I managed to complete a full 12 hours of
      work without any significant difficulties. I thoroughly enjoyed starting
      Dr. Angela Yu's course—her calm and relaxed teaching style, combined with
      excellent visuals, made it easy to grasp the material. I particularly
      appreciated the mini-projects included with each video, which allowed me
      to immediately apply what I learned. Additionally, I found the main
      projects at the end of each section highly rewarding, and I plan to build
      on them further to include in a future portfolio section.
