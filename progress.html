    <h2>Roadmap</h2>
    <p>
      So after spending many hours researching the best way to learn, as a
      visual learner, I decided to go with Udemy courses. These are high-quality
      video courses that I can learn from experienced tutors.

      So after spending many hours researching the best way to learn, as a
      visual learner, I decided to go with Udemy courses. These are high-quality
      video courses that I can learn from experienced tutors.
    </p>
    <p>
      After checking out many tutors on Udemy, I started to try out the two most
      popular tutors for web development, Dr. Angela Yu and Colt Steele.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the roadmap, I allocated the hours for each course based on its
      estimated duration. In programming courses, it’s recommended to spend 4–5
      hours practicing and applying concepts for every hour spent watching
      videos to effectively reinforce your learning.

      Day 1 was a great success, as I managed to complete a full 12 hours of
      work without any significant difficulties. I thoroughly enjoyed starting
      Dr. Angela Yu's course—her calm and relaxed teaching style, combined with
      excellent visuals, made it easy to grasp the material.
    </p>

    <p>
      I particularly appreciated the mini-projects included with each video,
      which allowed me to immediately apply what I learned.
    </p>

    <p>
      Additionally, I found the main projects at the end of each section highly
      rewarding, and I plan to build on them further to include in a future
      portfolio section.
    </p>

    <h3>Day 2: November 21, 2024, 6 hours (18/1000)</h3>
    <h4>Activities</h4>

    <h4>Summary</h4>
    <p>
      Day 2 was a success! CSS is definitely more challenging than HTML, but I’m
      enjoying the process and looking forward to making my blog visually
      appealing.
    </p>

    <p>
      Dr. Angela Yu’s teaching style is unique—she often provides pre-written
      code rather than typing everything out. Initially, I wasn’t sure about
      this approach, but I’m starting to appreciate it. It saves time and allows
      me to dive into creating my own projects more quickly.
    </p>

    <p>
      I’m also really liking the course structure so far, and I’m hopeful the
      quality remains consistent throughout!
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        The web design agency website was very tricky, as it was a significant
        step up from the tutorials. There were also a couple of things that
        hadn't been covered in the lectures before.
      </li>
      <li>
        I needed to re-watch the positioning video to fully understand the
        different position properties.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Summary</h4>
    <p>
      Day 3 was another productive day, though I can feel the challenges
      becoming more intense. Despite the increasing difficulty, it's exciting to
      explore more creative possibilities. That said, the web design agency
      project felt a bit too advanced compared to the earlier tutorials.

    <h4>Summary</h4>
    <p>
      Day 6 was an unusual day. I completed Sections 9 and 10 of Dr. Angela Yu's
      course, but I got distracted when I noticed that Northcoders announced a
      new date for their full-time JavaScript bootcamp. Despite the distraction,
      it was a productive day overall, and moving forward, I'll focus on
      Northcoders tutorials and test challenges.

    <p>
      Day 7 was a highly productive and enjoyable day! I spent time tackling
      Northcoders coding challenges, which were both engaging and insightful.
      These challenges pushed me to think critically and apply concepts in new
      ways. After that, I continued to build on my skills by practicing
