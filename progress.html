      Every hour counts—follow my journey as I log my coding sessions, track
      milestones, and reflect on my growth.

    <h2>Roadmap</h2>
    <p>
      So after spending many hours researching the best way to learn, as a
      visual learner, I decided to go with Udemy courses. These are high-quality
      video courses that I can learn from experienced tutors.

      So after spending many hours researching the best way to learn, as a
      visual learner, I decided to go with Udemy courses. These are high-quality
      video courses that I can learn from experienced tutors.
    </p>
    <p>
      After checking out many tutors on Udemy, I started to try out the two most
      popular tutors for web development, Dr. Angela Yu and Colt Steele.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the roadmap, I allocated the hours for each course based on its
      estimated duration. In programming courses, it’s recommended to spend 4–5
      hours practicing and applying concepts for every hour spent watching
      videos to effectively reinforce your learning.

      <li>Blog: Started building the blog using HTML.</li>
      <li>Project: Began working on three separate projects.</li>

        Additionally, I completed a capstone project for learning purposes,
        though I haven’t posted it on GitHub yet.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
      <li>Learned all the basics of HTML.</li>
      <li>Gained knowledge on how to host websites on GitHub.</li>
      <li>
        With the basics of HTML and GitHub, I was able to create and host a

      </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Challenges</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>None so far! A very good start</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Summary</h4>
    <p>
      Day 1 was a great success, as I managed to complete a full 12 hours of
      work without any significant difficulties. I thoroughly enjoyed starting
      Dr. Angela Yu's course—her calm and relaxed teaching style, combined with
      excellent visuals, made it easy to grasp the material.
    </p>

    <p>
      I particularly appreciated the mini-projects included with each video,
      which allowed me to immediately apply what I learned.
    </p>

    <p>
      Additionally, I found the main projects at the end of each section highly
      rewarding, and I plan to build on them further to include in a future
      portfolio section.
    </p>

    <h3>Day 2: November 21, 2024, 6 hours (18/1000)</h3>
    <h4>Activities</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Course: Completed Modules 5 and 6 on CSS.</li>
      <li>Project: Began working on two separate projects.</li>
      <li>Made small edits to the blog to improve readability.</li>

    <h4>Key Learnings</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Learned how to inspect websites.</li>
      <li>Learned some basics of CSS.</li>
      <li>Learned how to center divs on the screen.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Challenges</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        It took me a while to figure out how to center a div on the screen.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Summary</h4>
    <p>
      Day 2 was a success! CSS is definitely more challenging than HTML, but I’m
      enjoying the process and looking forward to making my blog visually
      appealing.
    </p>

    <p>
      Dr. Angela Yu’s teaching style is unique—she often provides pre-written
      code rather than typing everything out. Initially, I wasn’t sure about
      this approach, but I’m starting to appreciate it. It saves time and allows
      me to dive into creating my own projects more quickly.
    </p>

    <p>
      I’m also really liking the course structure so far, and I’m hopeful the
      quality remains consistent throughout!
    </p>

    <h3>Day 3: November 22, 2024, 6 hours (18/1000)</h3>
    <h4>Activities</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Course: Completed Modules 7 and 8 on CSS.</li>
      <li>Project: Began working on two separate projects.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Key Learnings</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Learned how to position items using position properties.</li>
      <li>Learned how to combine CSS selectors.</li>
      <li>
        Learned the basics of how to create responsive websites using media
        queries.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Challenges</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The web design agency website was very tricky, as it was a significant
        step up from the tutorials. There were also a couple of things that
        hadn't been covered in the lectures before.
      </li>
      <li>
        I needed to re-watch the positioning video to fully understand the
        different position properties.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Summary</h4>
    <p>
      Day 3 was another successful day, but I can feel the difficulty already
      ramping up. While things are getting more difficult, the ability to create
      more creative things is fun. I do think the web design agency website was
      a little too hard compared to the previous tutorials.
