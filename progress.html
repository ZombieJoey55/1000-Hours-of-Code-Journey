    <h2>Roadmap</h2>
    <p>
      So after spending many hours researching the best way to learn, as a
      visual learner, I decided to go with Udemy courses. These are high-quality
      video courses that I can learn from experienced tutors.
    </p>

    <p>
      The drawback of this learning approach is the risk of falling into
      "tutorial hell," where students follow along with tutorials but fail to
      actively apply the knowledge they’ve gained in practical, real-world
      scenarios. I plan to overcome this by creating my own projects based on
      what I’ve learned or enhancing the course projects with additional
      features and functionality.
    </p>

      After checking out many tutors on udemy, I started to try out the two most
      popular tutors for web development, Dr. Angela and Colt Steele.
