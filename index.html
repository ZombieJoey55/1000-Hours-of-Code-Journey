    <h2>Welcome to My 1000 Hours of code Journey</h2>
    <p>
      Join me as I embark on a transformative journey to master coding, one hour
      at a time. Through this challenge, I'll push my boundaries, learn new
      skills, and build exciting projects!
    </p>
    <h3>Why 1000 Hours?</h3>
    <p>
      Mastery takes time, and 1000 hours is my roadmap to becoming the coder I
      strive to be. This site documents my journey, highlighting the progress,
      challenges, and successes along the way. Many consider 1000 hours to be
      the pivotal threshold for gaining enough experience to land a junior
      developer role.

    <h2>Rules</h2>

    <h3>The Challenge Rules</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Commit to coding at least 40 hours per week, aiming to reach the
        1000-hour milestone in just 6 months.
      </li>
      <li>
        Apply any new skills I learn to the blog, using them to gain hands-on
        experience and solidify my understanding.
      </li>
      <li>
        Log every coding session with details about time, skills, and insights.
      </li>
      <li>Celebrate milestones at 100, 500, and 1000 hours.</li>
      <li>Share progress transparently—successes and struggles alike.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>How This Challenge Works</h3>
    <p>
      I’ll track every minute spent coding—whether it’s learning new concepts,
      building projects, or contributing to open source. Consistency over
      perfection is the goal!
    </p>
    <h3>Setting the Ground Rules</h3>
    <p>
      To ensure my journey stays productive and meaningful, here are my guiding
      principles
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Progress is measured in hours, not outcomes</li>
      <li>Projects must be hands-on and practical</li>
      <li>No coding session is too short—every effort counts</li>
      <li>
        To avoid getting stuck in "tutorial hell," I will actively apply what I
        learn to real-world projects.
      </li>
    </ul>
