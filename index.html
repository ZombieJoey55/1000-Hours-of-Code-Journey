    <h1>My Coding Journey</h1>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      I’m thrilled to share that I’ve secured a spot at Northcoders with a full
      scholarship, and I can’t wait to start on January 27th!
    </p>
    <p>
      To make the most of this amazing opportunity, I’ll be documenting my
      journey—not only my progress during the course but also the preparation
      and pre-course work I’ll be doing to gear up for the bootcamp.
    </p>
    <p>Stay tuned for updates on this exciting chapter of my coding journey!</p>
    <h2>Roadmap</h2>
    <p>
      To ensure I hit the ground running when I start the course, I will make
      sure to do the following.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Complete the Northcoders pre-course three times, as repetition will be
        key to success.
      </li>
      <li>
        Complete Dr. Angela Yu's 'The Complete 2024 Web Development Bootcamp'
        course on Udemy.
      </li>
      <li>
        I will also complete projects alongside the web development course to
        avoid tutorial hell.
      </li>
      <li>
        I will choose a website to complete extra coding challenges to fortify
        my knowledge.
